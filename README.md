Package for controlling [WLED](https://know.wled.ge/) project using ROS 2 stack. The package was created to integrate the lights controller with experiments involving a robotic manipulator and tool cameras.

Originally developed for integration with Robotic Manipulator with tool cameras, [AEGIS_ROS](https://github.com/AGH-CEAI/aegis_ros) and ROS 2 Humble.

It is possible to modify this repository to fit your needs. **PRs are welcome!**

## Quick Start

Get you WLED controller, compatible led stripes and power supply. Connect electrically, power on and configure:
- IP address
- Number of leds
- All segments you want to control separately

Make sure the system works using UI provided by WLED Project.

### Setup

1. Download repo and build package
```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.sh
git clone git@github.com:AGH-CEAI/wled_ros_driver.git
colcon build --symlink-install
source ./install/setup.bash
```

### Test

1.Configure your WLED IP address and scene parameters in the configuration file:
```
wled_ros_driver/config/scenes.yaml
```
2. Start the server using the launch file:
```bash
ros2 launch wled_ros_driver wled_service.launch.py
```
3. Call the commands (another terminal)
```bash
source ./install/setup.sh
```

Usage examples:
```bash
python3 src/wled_ros_driver/wled_ros_driver/wled_ros_driver/wled_client.py <scene> <section> <effect_id> <params (optional, only fi scene_custom selected)>

python3 src/wled_ros_driver/wled_ros_driver/wled_ros_driver/wled_client.py scene_1 section_1 0
python3 src/wled_ros_driver/wled_ros_driver/wled_ros_driver/wled_client.py scene_custom section_1 1 "255 255 127 127" (brightness red green blue)
python3 src/wled_ros_driver/wled_ros_driver/wled_ros_driver/wled_client.py scene_off section_1
```
or by using ros2 service:
```bash
source ./install/setup.sh
```

Usage examples:
```bash
ros2 service call /wled_change_scene wled_interfaces/srv/ChangeScene "{scene: 'scene_1', section: 'section_1', effect_id: 0}"
ros2 service call /wled_change_scene wled_interfaces/srv/ChangeScene "{scene: 'scene_custom', section: 'section_1', effect_id: 1, optional_params: '255 127 127 63'}"
ros2 service call /wled_change_scene wled_interfaces/srv/ChangeScene "{scene: 'scene_off', section: 'section_1'}"
```

You should see LEDs turn on and off.

### All available services

| Service              | Description                                                                                                  | Example                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/wled_change_scene` | Changes the active WLED scene by applying the requested scene, section, effect, and optional parameters.     | `ros2 service call /wled_change_scene wled_interfaces/srv/ChangeScene "{scene: 'scene_1', section: 'section_1', effect_id: 0}"`            |
| `/wled_define_scene` | Creates a new scene or updates an existing scene with the provided name, color and brightness configuration. | `ros2 service call /wled_define_scene wled_interfaces/srv/DefineScene "{scene_name: 'test_scene', color: [100, 0, 100], brightness: 100}"` |
| `/wled_get_scenes`   | Returns the names and configuration parameters of all currently defined scenes.                              | `ros2 service call /wled_get_scenes wled_interfaces/srv/GetScenes "{}"`                                                                    |
  | `/wled_get_sections` | Returns the names and LED ranges of all currently configured sections.                                       | `ros2 service call /wled_get_sections wled_interfaces/srv/GetSections "{}"`                                                                |

| `/wled_effects`       | Topic publisher that publishes all availible led effects and their ids in format id1:effect1;id2:effect2 ...| `ros2 topic echo /wled_effects` |

### Available scenes

You may pick between the following scenarios:
| Argument       | Description                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `scene_1`      | Led red, 100% brightness        |
| `scene_2`      | Led green, 100% brightness      |
| `scene_3`      | Led blue, 50% brightness        |
| `scene_4`      | Led yellow, 50% brightness      |
| `scene_off`    | Led off                         |
| `scene_custom` | custom color, custom brightness |

### Availibile sections
Section data will be fetched automatically from your led controller.
Section's names are set automatically to be `section_<section_number>` where `section_1` is the first segment defined on your WLED controller, followed by `section_2`, `section_3` ...

For controlling all leds simultaneously, use `section_all`

### Availibile effects
Effects are loaded directly form wled controller. Tu run selected effect, you need to pass `effect_id`.

When no value is present, default is 0 (no effect).

### Custom scene parameters

For `scene_custom`, pass the parameters as space-separated values:

```
brightness color_red color_green color_blue
```

**Example:**
```
255 127 127 63
```

## Development notes

### pre-commit
This project uses various tools for aiding the quality of the source code. Currently most of them are executed by the `pre-commit`. As a faster alternative it is suggested to use `prek`. Please make sure to enable its hooks:

```bash
# In case of pre-commit
pre-commit install
# In case of prek
prek install
```
